Stephen is a PhD student in the Applied Health Sciences faculty at the University of Waterloo. On campus, Stephen works with the UNs HeForShe initiative to facilitate monthly discussions with men around healthier ideas of manhood. Stephen recently wrote a chapter in the edited collection, Feminisms in Leisure Studies, which explored the #MeToo movement, millennial mobilization, and men's accountability. Prior to returning to academia, Stephen worked for four year as the co-ordinator of the Male Allies program, a public education initiative run by the Sexual Assault Support Centre of Waterloo Region (SASC).
