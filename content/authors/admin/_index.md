My research and activism centre around creating healthier, more just communities. On campus at the Univeristy of Waterloo, I worked extensively with the Athletics Department to train all incoming male student-athletes around consent and healthy relationships; as well as with the [UNs HeForShe](https://https://www.heforshe.org/en/) initiative -- providing support and training around gender equity for [faculty and campus advocates](https://uwaterloo.ca/heforshe/). In the Wateroo Region, I support and volunteer with a number of [community-based restorative justice initatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW0juNi-wb4/) designed to provide re-integration support for men in conflcit with the law.

Two years ago, I founded [Gender Equity Consulting](https://genderequity.ca/). Through this social enterprise, I have provided equity-based support and training for a variety of organizations; ranging from non-profits like [Mennonite Central Committee](https://mcccanada.ca/) to multi-national corporations such as [Manulife](https://manulife.com/), [Rogers](https://rogers.com/), and [Vidyard](https://vidyard.com).
